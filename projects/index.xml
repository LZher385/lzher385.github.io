This bot is targeted at customers who might be unavailable to receive the package on the stipulated delivery date, and might want to reschedule the delivery. It is also designed for users who are willing to pay more to get faster deliveries, but are unable to do so as online retailers often only offer the cheapest (and thus slowest) delivery option.</description></item><item><title>gitGud</title><link>https://lzher385.github.io/projects/creations/gitgud/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2022 04:22:56 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://lzher385.github.io/projects/creations/gitgud/</guid><description>Description gitGud is a desktop application for storing and managing your friends&amp;rsquo; gaming information and schedules.
