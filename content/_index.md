Passionate Software Engineer and Aspiring Entrepreneur. I am:
- keen to learn about the best practices in the industry and write code that is clean and efficient in order to create products that are easy to maintain and resilient to failure. I am particularly interested in the different ways to mitigate technical debt when it comes to startups.
- always on the lookout for opportunities to pick up new skills and gain more knowledge about almost anything. I value interdisciplinarity and strive to be well-rounded in many areas.
